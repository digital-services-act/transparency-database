            On this page, you can download daily archives of statements of reasons. Full archive files contain
            all of the public data of the individual statements of reasons submitted on a given day, i.e. each
            file contains the entire attribute schema of the database. Light archive files do not contain free
            text attributes with a character limit higher than 2000 characters, i.e. they do not contain the
            attributes illegal_content_explanation, incompatible_content_explanation & decision_facts. Light
            archive files also do not contain the territorial_scope attribute. The archiving feature is currently
            in a beta version and the file structure might change in future iterations, with additional file
            formats being considered as well.
