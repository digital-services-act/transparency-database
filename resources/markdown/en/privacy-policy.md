## 1. Introduction

The European Commission (hereafter ‘the Commission’) is committed to protecting your personal data and to respecting

European Parliament and of the Council, of 23 October 2018, on the protection of natural persons with regard to the
processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such
data (repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001).

This privacy statement explains the reason for the processing of your personal data, the way we collect, handle and

The information in relation to processing operation “Access to the Transparency Database for submission of statements
of reasons” undertaken by CNECT F.1 and F.2 is presented below.

## 2. Why and how do we process your personal data?

Purpose of the processing operation: CNECT F.1 and F.2 process your personal data to grant you access to the
Transparency Database, that is to say the database set up by the Commission to allow providers of online platforms to
submit the decisions and the statements of reasons referred to in Article 17(1) of the DSA.

Your personal data will not be used for automated decision-making including profiling.

## 3. On what legal ground(s) do we process your personal data

We process your personal data because processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public
interest (Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725).

The underlying Union law is Article 24(5) of <a target="_blank" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2022/2065/oj">Regulation (EU) 2022/2065</a> of the European Parliament and of the Council, of
19 October 2022, on a Single Market For Digital Services and amending Directive 2000/31/EC (Digital Services Act) (
hereinafter the "DSA"), which reads "5. Providers of online platforms shall, without undue delay, submit to the
Commission the decisions and the statements of reasons referred to in Article 17(1) for the inclusion in a publicly
accessible machine-readable database managed by the Commission. Providers of online platforms shall ensure that the
information submitted does not contain personal data."

## 4. Which personal data do we collect and further process?

In order to carry out this processing operation, CNECT F.1 and F.2 collect the following categories of personal data:

- Mandatory data collected through EU Login: username (login identifier), First name, Last name, email address;
- Additional information: name of employer (platform).

## 5. How long do we keep your personal data?

CNECT F.1 and F.2 will only keep your personal data for the time necessary to fulfil the purpose of collection or
further processing. The information is retained for the time during which the data subject is entrusted with
responsibilities that include submitting to the Commission the decisions and the statements of reasons referred to in
Article 17(1) DSA. When the data subject’s responsibilities no longer include submitting statements of reasons to the
Commission, their employer should make the Commission aware of the change in the data subject’s responsibilities.
Personal data will be deleted as soon as the Commission is notified that the person in question is no more recognised as
being an authorised user and by two weeks from the notification at the latest.

## 6. How do we protect and safeguard your personal data?

All personal data in electronic format (e-mails, documents, databases, uploaded batches of data, etc.) are stored either
on the servers of the Commission or those of the processors. All processing operations are carried out pursuant to the
<a target="_blank" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1548093747090&uri=CELEX:32017D0046">Commission Decision (EU, Euratom) 2017/46</a>, of 10 January 2017, on the security of communication and information systems
in the European Commission.

The Commission’s contractors are bound by a specific contractual clause for any processing operations of your data on
behalf of the Commission, and by the confidentiality obligations deriving from the transposition of the General Data
Protection Regulation in the EU Member States (‘GDPR’ <a target="_blank" href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679">Regulation (EU) 2016/679)</a>.

In order to protect your personal data, the Commission has put in place a number of technical and organisational
measures in place. Technical measures include appropriate actions to address online security, risk of data loss,
alteration of data or unauthorised access, taking into consideration the risk presented by the processing and the nature
of the personal data being processed. Organisational measures include restricting access to the personal data solely to
authorised persons with a legitimate need to know for the purposes of this processing operation.

## 7. Who has access to your personal data and to whom is it disclosed?

Access to your personal data is provided to the Commission staff responsible for carrying out this processing operation
and to authorised staff according to the “need to know” principle. Such staff abide by statutory, and when required,
additional confidentiality agreements.

Please note that pursuant to Article 3(13) of the Regulation, public authorities (e.g. Court of Auditors, EU Court of
Justice) which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member
State law shall not be regarded as recipients. The further processing of those data by those public authorities shall be
in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.

The information we collect will not be given to any third party, except to the extent and for the purpose we may be
required to do so by law.
