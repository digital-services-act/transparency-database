## Overview

The webform is made available as a submission method for the providers of online platforms that expect to submit a low volume of statements of reasons to the DSA Transparency Database.

## Requesting Webform access

Please refer to the [Platform Onboarding page](/profile/page/onboarding) for the process on how to be granted access to the DSA Transparency Database to create statements of reasons. Once you have created your account (as per the onboarding steps) you can access the webform and use it to submit statements of reasons:

Once you are onboarded via your Digital Service Coordinator, you will gain access to a sandbox environment where you can test your webform submissions to the DSA Transparency Database.

When the testing phase is completed, you will be able to move to the production environment of the DSA Transparency Database, where you can start submitting your statements of reasons via the webform.

## How to use the Webform
The webform is a form to be filled in by the providers of online platforms, with details and explanations given in each section. Providers using the webform can also refer to the [Global Documentation](/profile/page/documentation) for additional details on the statements of reasons fields and structure.

## Submit a statement of reasons via the Webform
You can access the webform in the production environment [here](https://transparency.dsa.ec.europa.eu/statement/create). Once you are done filling in all the fields, you can submit the statement of reasons by clicking the “Create the Statement of Reasons” button. You can then return to the webform to create the next statement of reasons.
