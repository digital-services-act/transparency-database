## Overview

The webform is intended for use by platforms who have a requirement to submit a lower volume of statements of reasons to the Transparency Database of the DSA (Digital Services Act).

Once you are onboarded via your Digital Service Coordinator, you will gain access to a testing/sandbox environment to test your submissions to the DSA Transparency Database, which you can perform via a webform.

When the testing phase is completed, you will be able to move to the production environment of the DSA Transparency Database, where you can start submitting your statement of reasons via a webform.
