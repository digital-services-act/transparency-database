#### Overview
<p class="ecl-u-type-paragraph" style="max-width:none !important">
The webform is intended for use by platforms who have a requirement to submit a lower volume of statements of reasons to the Transparency Database of the DSA (Digital Services Act).
</p>

<p class="ecl-u-type-paragraph" style="max-width:none !important">
To set up your statement of reasons submission process, you can either:
</p>
<p class="ecl-u-type-paragraph" style="max-width:none !important">
a) register on EU survey <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/DSA-ComplianceStamentsReasons">here</a> regarding your obligations under article 24(5) of the DSA (Digital Services Act). After receiving your registration form, the Digital Service Coordinator of your Member State will contact you, providing the details on how to complete the onboarding of your online platform: or
b) contact the Digital Service Coordinator of your Member State directly in order to commence the onboarding process. The current list of Digital Service Coordinators is available here: <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/dsa-cooperation">The cooperation framework under the Digital Services Act</a>
</p>

<p class="ecl-u-type-paragraph" style="max-width:none !important">
Once you are onboarded via your Digital Service Coordinator, you will gain access to a sandbox environment to test your submissions to the DSA Transparency Database, which you can perform via the webform, according to the volume of your data and technical needs.
</p>

<p class="ecl-u-type-paragraph" style="max-width:none !important">
