**Legal Disclaimer**: As established under Article 24(5) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 on a Single
Market For Digital Services and amending Directive 2000/31/EC (Digital Services Act), or the ‘DSA’, providers
of online platforms shall submit their decisions and statements of reasons referred to in Article 17(1) DSA to
be included in the DSA Transparency Database. This publicly accessible machine-readable database is managed by
the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology of the Commission. The purpose of
the database is to provide insights and transparency on the content moderation practices by online platforms.
The Commission does not review the information submitted from the providers of online platforms.

**Personal data**: In accordance with Article 24(5) DSA, this database shall not contain personal
data. It is the obligation of the providers of online platforms to ensure that the information that they submit
does not contain any personal data.

**Report an issue**: It is possible to report problems with individual statements of reasons in
this database, using a dedicated button located at the bottom of the page. This functionality can be used, for
example, if a statement of reasons contains personal information despite the fact that providers of online platforms 
must ensure that all personal data is redacted before the submission into the database.

**Information on possibilities for redress**:  Article 17(3)(f) DSA requires providers of hosting
services to include in their statements of reasons clear and user-friendly information on the possibilities
for redress available to the recipient of the service in respect of the decision. When it comes to online
platforms, these redress options include an internal complaint-handling mechanism, as per Article 20 DSA,
out-of-court dispute settlement, as per Article 21 DSA, and judicial redress. As these options are always
available to users but the practicalities may depend on each individual case, this database does not include
the relevant information in the individual entries.

**Affected online platforms**: Designated very large online platforms need to comply with the DSA
four months after their designation. For all other online platforms, the DSA is applicable as of
17 February 2024. In accordance with Article 19(1) DSA, Article 24(5) DSA does not apply to providers of
online platforms that qualify as micro or small enterprises as defined in Recommendation 2003/361/EC.
Therefore, this database will not collect the statements of reasons of such online platforms.
