Providers of intermediary services will start using the templates laid out in the DSA Transparency Reporting Implementing Regulation as of 1 July 2025. To ensure consistency between the transparency tools of the DSA, the submission schema of the DSA Transparency Database will be updated as of 1 July 2025 to reflect the requirements laid down in the Implementing Regulation on Transparency Reporting.

This entails several changes to the reporting schema of the DSA Transparency Database, including several new categories and keyword specifications to classify the content reported in the database.

Additionally, to better enable companies to classify moderated content, an option to report unique content identifiers will be added to the DSA Transparency Database schema. Starting from 1 July 2025, the variable content_id will be available to report content identifiers which do not contain personal information, including existing identifiers of illegal content. The API will initially only accept the EAN13 product number as a content identifier.

To allow providers to prepare, the updated schema will be available for extensive testing in the sandbox environment of the DSA Transparency Database from 2 April to 30 June 2025.
