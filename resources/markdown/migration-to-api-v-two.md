Providers on intermediary services will start using the templates laid out in the DSA Transparency Reporting Implementing Regulation as of 1 July 2025. To ensure consistency between the transparency tools of the DSA, the submission schema of the DSA Transparency Database will be updated as of 1 July 2025 to reflect the requirements laid down in the Implementing Regulation on Transparency Reporting.

This entails several changes to the reporting schema of the DSA Transparency Database, including several new categories and keyword specifications to classify the content reported in the database.

Additionally, to better enable companies to classify moderated content, an option to report unique content identifiers will be added to the DSA Transparency Database schema. Starting from 1 July 2025, the variable content_identifier will be available to report product identifiers. The API will initially accept the EAN13 product number.

To allow providers to prepare, the updated schema will be available for extensive testing in the sandbox environment of the DSA Transparency Database in Q2 of 2025.

The full documentation of the APIv2 is available [here](/page/api-documentation-two)
