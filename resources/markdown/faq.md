# DSA Transparency Database FAQ

_Frequently Asked Questions and Answers_

<x-ecl.accordion label="What is the DSA Transparency Database?">
Article 17 of the Digital Services Act requires all providers of hosting services to provide clear and specific 
information, called statements of reasons, to users whenever they remove or restrict access to certain content. A 
statement of reasons is an important tool to empower users to understand and potentially challenge content 
moderation decisions taken by providers of hosting services. The DSA Transparency Database collects the statements 
of reasons submitted by providers of online platforms to the Commission, in line with Article 24(5) DSA. The 
database is publicly accessible and machine-readable.
