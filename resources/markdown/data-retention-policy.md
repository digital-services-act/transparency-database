**Effective Date**: 18 February 2025 

**Purpose**: This Data Retention Policy is established in accordance with the guidelines set by the European Commission for the management and retention of data in the DSA Transparency Database. The policy outlines the duration for which data will be retained and the procedures for data deletion, ensuring compliance with relevant legislation and regulations. 

**Statement of Reasons (SoR)**: Each SoR will be accessible via the [Search Statement of Reasons](/statement) page for a period of six months (180 days) from the date it is entered into the Transparency Database. After six months, the SoR will be removed from the search index but will remain accessible in the CSV format within the [daily dumps files](/explore-data/download). The SoR will continue to contribute to the dataset presented in the [Dashboard](/dashboard).

**Daily Dumps Files**: Daily dumps and aggregated data views will be available for download for a period of 5 years after their creation date. Once this period has elapsed, daily dumps will be transferred to cold storage.

**Dashboard**: The Dashboard will display aggregated statistics incorporating the most recent 5 years of collected data. Data beyond the 5-year window will not be reflected in the Dashboard's statistics.  

**Storage and Security**: All data within the Transparency Database will be stored securely in accordance with the European Commission's standards for data protection. 

**Policy Implementation and Review**: This Data Retention Policy will be implemented as of 18 February 2025, replacing its previous version in effect from 15 April 2024. Compared to the first version of the data retention policy, the retention period for the data download was extended in time (5 years instead of 18 months) and scope (additional formats). This policy may be reviewed and amended periodically where necessary. Any amendments to this policy will be communicated promptly to users of the Database in the dedicated [Announcements page](/page/announcements). 

**Policy Questions**: For any questions regarding this Data Retention Policy, please [write to us](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/write-us). 

This policy is intended to balance the need for access to information with the obligation to protect sensitive data and comply with the established legal framework. 

**Acknowledgment**: By using the Transparency Database, users acknowledge and agree to the terms set forth in the [Legal Notice](/page/legal-information) and this Data Retention Policy.
