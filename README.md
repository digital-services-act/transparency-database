DSA Transparency Database [![Laravel](https://github.com/digital-services-act/transparency-database/actions/workflows/vapor.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/digital-services-act/transparency-database/actions/workflows/vapor.yml)
=========================

The DSA Transparency Database collects the statements of reasons submitted by providers of online platforms to the
Commission, in accordance with Article 24(5) of the DSA to enable scrutiny over the content moderation decisions of the
providers of online platforms and to monitor the spread of illegal and other harmful content online.

Automated Submissions using an API
==================================

The [Transparency Database](https://transparency.dsa.ec.europa.eu/) has an API that allows providers of online platforms that issue large numbers of statements of
reasons to submit them without using the web interface. To learn about the capabilities of the API, you can consult the [API documentation](https://transparency.dsa.ec.europa.eu/page/api-documentation).

Search Using an API (not yet implemented, for future releases)
==============================================================

The Commission is considering a Search API that allows interested individuals, in particular from the research community, to extract large volumes of data from the database, in future releases of the database.
